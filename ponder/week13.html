 <h1>Many Uses For Jquery</h1>
    
 
   <div class="tabs">
   
   <nav class="tab-list">
      
  <a class="tab active" href="#one">Lesson One</a>
    
    <a class="tab" href="#two">Lesson Two</a>
    
    <a class="tab" href="#three">Lesson Three</a>
      </nav>
      
  
    <div id="one" class="tab-content show"> There are many uses to Jquery that
      
  are superior to using basic Javascript.  The first is how smooth you can
 
       make every action.</div>
      
 
     <div id="two" class="tab-content"> Rather than needing something to jump
 
        from one section to the next, much of Jquery is designed to nearly glide

        from one section to the next. This can help with making the user forget

        that the same process of loading new content is still occuring, it just

        looks more natural.</div>

     
 <div id="three" class="tab-content">By making the information more natural

        it feels more real and less artifical.</div>

    <h1>What Will Happen to Jquery</h1>
 
   
    <div class="accordion">
 
     <div class="accordion-header">Why is it popular right now? </div>

      <div class="accordion-content">As I stated earlier, I think one the the

        major appeals of Jquery is the smooth quality it creates on its web pages

        The real question is if this is a fad, a style that will eventually
 
        become unfashionable or if it is simply an improvement.</div>
 
     <div class="accordion-header">Jquery vs Older formats</div>

      <div class="accordion-content">The reason Why I question whether it will
 
        stay is because there are many styles of web pages that have come and
 
        gone simply because they were no longer cool.  One Example is how every

        website used to have a lot of colors and flashy links, but just like

        keeping christmas decorations up too long it became tacky.
      </div>


      <div class="accordion-header">Moderation</div>

      <div class="accordion-content">Ultimately I feel like websites are better

        by using jquery, but only if you don't use it too much.  Having lights

        and a few decorations for Christmas looks nice, but when you have your

        whole yard and house so covered you can't see anything else it no longer
 
       has any appeal.  If websites can remember this then they will be able to 

        have a very useful tool at their disposal.
