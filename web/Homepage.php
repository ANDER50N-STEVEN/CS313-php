              Hi, my name is Steven Anderson.  I feel like you never realize how
			boring your life is until you try and describe your interests.  Anyway, 
			some of the things I like doing are hiking/camping even though I feel like
			I might be getting too old for that, or at least my body thinks so. <br />
              Along with the outdoors, I love reading.  My dream one day is to have a
			  sitting room in my home where I can have thousands of books on shelves and
			  have the time to read anything and everything I want.

              My wife and I recently moved to Portland oregon because she just graduated
				and got a job out here. Our hope is that I will be able to finish my degree
				 online.  Originally I am from Southern California so the rain is something
I'm going to have to get used to, but it'll be better than the sub zero tempuratures in Rexburg.
