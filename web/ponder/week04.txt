After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Provide a link to your myDb.sql file at GitHub (the file that contains all the SQL commands needed to create your database).

https://github.com/MisterANDER50N/CS313-php/blob/master/db/project1_initial.sql

2. Describe something from your database that you think came together very nicely.

I was pleased to be able to include things that I had thought would be optional, 
such as personal reviews, as optional text locations in the tables.

3. Describe something from your database that you think could be improved or extended in the future.

I'm not sure if I should have made authors its own table or not, the information 
shouldn't be necessary elsewhere but it might not be a bad idea for future development.

I also am sure that using JOIN has got to be useful somewhere but I just wasn't entirely
sure where or how to use it.

4. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.

How to create Schema's to organize information

5. Briefly describe two principles of good database design.

Dividing Information into seperate tables that might otherwise be repeated in many to many relationships.
Simple yet descriptive terms are best, one word is preffered but maintaining consistency if spaces is the next best thing.



6. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:

D - Meets requirements


7. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I feel that I only barely met the minimum requirements, although I did try and input
some data into my tables it was mostly to make sure everything was working correctly.
