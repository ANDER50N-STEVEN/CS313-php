After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application:
https://hidden-coast-53870.herokuapp.com/prove/week05/userSelect.php

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/MisterANDER50N/CS313-php

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.
Currently you can select the user you would like to "sign in" as, then you are presented with a login page where you are asked for a password, password doesn't work and so anything works.
Once logged in the user can see all of the different books they have reviewed and their ratings.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
I can't figure out how to transfer the id from the first page to the second so the sign in is hardcoded to the first id.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
How simple it was to input queries.

6. Why should you create a separate user account for your application to access the database?
so there is only one person who can modify the database

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:

C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate



8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I spent most of my time trying to get information to transfer between sessions but because I needed an integer it wouldn't work.
Because of this waste of time I was only able to make a handful of my databases accessable and they aren't formated very well at all.
All that being said I feel I am able to access information from the database very easily I just will need to change the sign in page.
